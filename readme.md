# Note

Small terminal editor based on the kilo editor.

Compiles only in linux environment (dependent on termios).

I added a few small quality-of-life features to make the user experience
better, but overall I still find this version of the editor lacking.

It is my first time manipulating the terminal in raw mode, and I think
overall the experience was really interesting.
